WooCommerce Pricefiles
======================

Generate pricefiles for integration with price comparison services.

For more information, visit the plugin page on WordPress.org: https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pricefiles/

I strongly recomend downloading the plugin from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pricefiles/) and not from GitHub because the versions are tested before they are uploaded there.


###Supported services
 -  [Prisjakt](http://www.prisjakt.nu/ "").
 -  [Pricerunner](http://www.pricerunner.se/ "").
 -  [Kelkoo](http://www.kelkoo.com/ "") (On hold. Will be developed if I feel there is enough sufficient demand. If you want it send me a message.).
 -  [Google Merchant Center](https://www.google.com/merchants/merchantdashboard "") (On hold. There are other plugins for this. Duplication of efforts vs all-in-one solution).

###Next version
The next major version(1.0) will be a major rewrite of the plugin. The code will be refactored to be a lot cleaner and easier to follow. 

There will also be focus on performance and getting the plugin to work on large WooCommerce stores with a lot of products. As a part of this the cachesystem will be revised and improved. 

Next version will include:
 -  Major rewrite of the code
 -  Support for variable products
 -  Rewrite and refactor the cron+cache functionality 
 -  More info on how to genereate pricefiles with cron and cache
 -  Support for multisite/network install
 -  Prisjakt sales tracking (avslutsuppföljning)
 -  Admin interface improvements
